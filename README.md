# Features üéâ

The whole [portfolio](https://sajid-personal-portfolio.vercel.app/) is a React-based single page app built with Next.js in Typescript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ‚úçüèª

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images üñºÔ∏è

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames

# ‚ú® Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sajidhussain1234/personal-portfolio.git
cd personal-portfolio/

# GITHUB_TOKEN is required for some parts

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
