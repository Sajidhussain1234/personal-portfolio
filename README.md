# Personal Portfolio 🚀

[![Site preview](/public/site-preview.png)](https://sajid.vercel.app/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills, experience, projects, and education as a developer. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). it not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance. View the [live site](https://sajid.vercel.app/).

# Features 🎉

The whole [portfolio](https://sajid.vercel.app/) is a React-based single page app built with Next.js in Typescript, using only statically generated pages.

# Fonts ✍🏻

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Project images 🖼️

All project images live under `public/images` and are automatically attached to each project based on the inclusion of the project's `slug` in their filenames

# ✨ Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sajidhussain1234/personal-portfolio.git

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
